# LEARN CSS

## CSS
Fundamentally, CSS is about declaring rules: Under various conditions, we want certain things to happen.
If this class is added to that element, apply these styles.

## Modal using CSS and Javascript
A modal is a dialog box/popup window that is displayed on top of the current page.

## Cascade - CSS in Depth
All three rulesets attempt to set a different font family to this heading. Which one will win? To determine the answer, the browser follows a set of rules, so the result is predictable. In this case, the rules dictate that the second declaration, which has an ID selector, wins; the title will have a sans-serif font.

The cascade is the name for this set of rules. It determines how conflicts are resolved, and itâ€™s a fundamental part of how the language works.
